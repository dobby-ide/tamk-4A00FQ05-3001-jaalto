#  REbasing a branch puts your local branch to the same commits 
#  where the latest commits are in the repo
#  so it moves the latest commit on top of that branch in 
#  order for the branch to continue its own commit history:
#  
#  supposing master is ahead and devel has some commits on its own branch:
#  on devel: git rebase master would put devel to the same commits
#  history of master, plus having contnuing its own developing
#  commits.
